Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard!
Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. 
Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. 
If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.



My solution 

SELECT h.hacker_id, h.name
FROM Hackers h
JOIN (
    SELECT s.hacker_id, COUNT(DISTINCT s.challenge_id) AS full_score_challenges
    FROM Submissions s
    JOIN (
        SELECT c.challenge_id, c.difficulty_level, d.score AS max_score
        FROM Challenges c
        JOIN Difficulty d ON c.difficulty_level = d.difficulty_level
    ) AS challenge_scores ON s.challenge_id = challenge_scores.challenge_id
    WHERE s.score = challenge_scores.max_score
    GROUP BY s.hacker_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT s.challenge_id) > 1
) AS full_score_hackers ON h.hacker_id = full_score_hackers.hacker_id
ORDER BY full_score_hackers.full_score_challenges DESC, h.hacker_id ASC
