# HackerRank-SQL-practicing

In this document, I want to share the solutions of some hardest problems I encountered on HackerRank. I will include my explanation to my solutions. 
I'm trying to get better at explaining codes and my thought process to other people. It will be a fun project for me.
(I used to fail an interview because I dind't explain my codes during the coding interview. 
Even though the code could solve the problem, it didn't mean anything if I didn't explain it. Now I know.)

Somehow I really like SQL, and I like to solve problems using SQL. My mind just clicks with SQL, and I've been enjoyed practicing it a lot.
